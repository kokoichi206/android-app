## ImageAnalysis
- A great way to make your camera app more interesting is using the ImageAnalysis feature.
- It allows you to define a custom class that implements the ImageAnalysis.Analyzer interface, and which will be called with incoming camera frames.
- You won't have to manage the camera session state or even dispose of images;
  - binding to our app's desired lifecycle is sufficient, like with other lifecycle-aware components.
